What differs from domain to domain is the specific nature of how an interface is invoked and how information is passed back and forth.

      "description": "Policies can apply to things other than elements; in fact, policies can apply to anything at all, including other policies. For instance, a security policy might specify which actors have the authority to change some other policy. The appliesTo property, and its inverse isSubjectTo, capture the abstract notion that a policy can apply to any instance of Thing. Note specifically that Element is a subclass of Thing, hence policies by inference can apply to any instance of Element.<p>In one direction, a policy can apply to zero (in the case where a policy has been formulated but not yet explicitly applied to anything), one, or more instances of Thing. Note that having a policy apply to multiple things does not mean that these things are the same, only that they are (partly) regulated by the same intent. In the other direction, an instance of Thing may be subject to zero, one, or more policies. Note that where multiple policies apply to the same instance of Thing this is often because the multiple policies are from multiple different policy domains (such as security and governance).<p>The SOA ontology does not attempt to enumerate different policy domains; such policy-focused details are deemed more appropriate for a policy ontology. It is worth pointing out that a particular policy ontology may also restrict (if desired) the kinds of things that policies can apply to.",

One aspect of this has already been addressed by the uses and usedBy properties in that we can use these to express the notion of systems of systems. This is still a very concrete relationship though, and does not express the concept of architectural abstraction. We find the need for architectural abstraction in various places such as a role representing the people playing that role, an organizational unit representing the people within it (subtly different from that same organizational unit using the people within it, as the represents relationship indicates the organizational unit as a substitute interaction point), an architectural building block representing an underlying construct (for instance, important to enterprise architects wanting to explicitly distinguish between constructs and building blocks), and an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) representing the services that are accessible through it (for instance, relevant when explicitly modeling operational interaction and dependencies). The concept of such an explicitly changing viewpoint, or level of abstraction, is captured by the represents and representedBy properties.",

Note specifically that some policies are set by multiple human actors in conjunction, meaning that all these human actors need to discuss and agree on the policy before it can take effect. A real-world example would be two parents in conjunction setting policies for acceptable child behavior. In the other direction, a human actor may potentially set (or be part of setting) multiple policies.<p>      The SOA ontology purposefully separates the setting of the policy itself and the application of the policy to one or more instances of Thing. In some cases these two acts may be inseparably bound together, yet in other cases they are definitely not. One such example is an overall compliance policy that is formulated at the corporate level yet applied by the compliance officer in each line of business.<p>      Also, while a particular case of interest for this ontology is that where the provider of a service has a policy for the service, a policy for a service is not necessarily owned by the provider. For example, government food and hygiene regulations (a policy that is law) cover restaurant services independently of anything desired or defined by the restaurant owner.",

The specifies property, and its inverse isSpecifiedBy, capture the abstract notion of a service contract specifying a particular effect as part of the agreement for using a service. Note that the specified effect can apply to both the interactionAspect datatype property (simply specifying what will happen when interacting with the service according to the service contract) and the legalAspect datatype property (specifying a contractually promised effect).<p>Anyone wanting a guaranteed effect of the interaction with a given service must ensure that the desired effect is specified in a service contract applying to that interaction. By definition, any service contract must specify at least one effect. In the other direction, an effect must be an effect of at least one service contract; this represents that fact that we have chosen only to formalize those effects that are specified by service contracts (and not all intrinsic effects of all services).",

      "description": "Elements may use other elements in various ways. In general, the notion of some element using another element is applied by practitioners for all of models, executables, and physical objects. What differs from domain to domain is the way in which such use is perceived. <p>An element uses another element if it interacts with it in some fashion. Interacts here is interpreted very broadly ranging through, for example, an element simply being a member of (used by) some system (see later for a formal definition of the System class), an element interacting with (using) another element (such as a service; see later for a formal definition of the Service class) in an ad hoc fashion, or even a strongly coupled dependency in a composition (see Section 5.2 for a formal definition of the Composition class). The uses property, and its inverse usedBy, capture the abstract notion of an element using another. These properties capture not just transient relations. Instantiations of the property can include “uses at this instant”, “has used”, and “may in future use”. <p>For the purposes of this ontology we have chosen not to attempt to enumerate and formally define the multitude of different possible semantics of a uses relationship. We leave the semantic interpretations to a particular sub-domain, application, or even design approach.",
